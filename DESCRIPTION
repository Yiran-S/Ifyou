Description: The package mainly includes the function that I used in MAE in 2020 Fall quarter. 

The "gene_APOD", "NBAData" and "fred_series" are mainly the API I used for 441 Applied Data Management for Economists.

The "decp_plot" solves th problem we meet in the project1 for Class 430 Applied Statistics, Econometrics, and Time Series with R and Python, 
when we need to describe all descriptive summary for lots of variables. 

The "irf_plot" helps plot impulse response function in 4 separate graphs.
